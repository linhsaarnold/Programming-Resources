    <h2>Question 1</h2>
    <h3>What is a backend server?</h3>
    <p>The back-end of a website is where the technical processes of runngin a website takes place. It is a necessary compliment to the front-end which is where the user of the website interacts with the site. Most often consisting of three parts, server, application, and database, these parts make up the process of the back-end.</p>
    <h3>What are 3 good resources for understanding servers?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>My textbook from my CSC 105 class: "Discovering COmputers 2017"</li>
        <li>Definitions through wikipedia: "Front and back ends"</li>
        <li>Pluralsite article, "What's the Difference Between the Front-End and Back-End?"</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What do you specifically like about these resources?</h3>
    <p>I liked these resources because they were easy to find though a quick google search, and were also easy to understand. They did not rely on any heavy use of jargon that would only be familiar to someone with a background in computer sciences, or in-depth knowledge of the mechanics of a website.</p>

    <h2>Question 2</h2>
    <h3>What is a SQL versus a NoSQL database?</h3>
    <p>SQL databses require you to add data into defined tables and fields (referred to as a "schema"). The schema contains things such as: primary keys, foreign keys, indexes, relationships, etc...</p>
    <p>NoSQL databases allow you to add data anywhere at anytime. Perhaps more suited to projects in which the initial data requirements are harder to find and define.</p>
    <h3>Why is one preferable to another?</h3>
    <p>It depends on your project or task at hand. Some are better suited to SQL databases while toher are better for NoSQL. Sometimes it doesn't matter and either option will do.</p>
    <h3>Two blog entries or courses on how to get started with SQL:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool">The Geek Stuff</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/sql-vs-nosql-differences/">SitePoint</a></li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Why do you like these?</h3>
    <p>For the same reason I liked the resources I selected for information on back-ends, these resources were easy to read through without feeling too bogged down with information. I have some background knowlodge on databases and writing queries through SQL in Microsoft Access, so these resources helped me build a little bit on the foundational knowledge that I had from before.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Question 3</h2>
    <h3>Where do you go to find help on javascript questions?</h3>
    <p>In order to get help on javascript questions I often first go through our class slides to see if we went over anything similar in class. After I resort to using Google, and can usually solve my problem through one of the many tutorials/resources on w3schools or stackoverflow.</p>
    <h3>Let's say you want to find information on how promises work in ES6. What does that mean?</h3>
    <p>ES6, aka "Harmony", is the upcoming 6th major release of ECMAScript language specification, which is the proper name for the language JavaScript. Promises are proxies for a value that will eventually become available, offering an alternative to callbacks and events. Since javascript is single threaded, it has to stop while it waits on network requestions. If it does not wait, no other code can be excuted (results in the browser stalling). If a function completes its execution but the results are unavailable until somethng happens, the function can return a "promise" object... this promises to eventually give the result you're looking for."</p>
    <h3>Make a list of at least 3 resources you consulted in finding that answer</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="http://dev.venntro.com/2013/09/es6-part-1/">Venntro</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6-promises-in-depth">ponyfoo</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2016/02/16/how-javascript-promises-work/">atomic object</a></li>
        </ol>
    </br>

    <h2>Question 4</h2>
    <h3>Imagine you are working on a problem with using git to merge files from another contributor on your project. What resources can you find to help you understand git merge?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Emailing my professor</li>
            <li>Consulting my notes or the class slides</li>
            <li>Consulting my peers through the classes slack channel</li>
            <li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5601931/best-and-safest-way-to-merge-a-git-branch-into-master">stackoverflow</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging">git-scm</a></li>
        </ul>
    <h3>On your system, what editor gets launched to show merges? How do you use it to edit text, save, and exit?</h3>
    <p>I use Visual Studio Code to edit all of my html, js, and css files... so that is the editor that shows merges. I use visual studio code to write and edit code from my github repositories, then I go into the terminal (I use a MAC) to push the changes I've made onto an existing github repository. While I edit my code I like to have the file open in Google Chrome to easily track the changes I'm making by refreshing the page.</p>
